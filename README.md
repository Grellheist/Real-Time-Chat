# Real Time Chat

This project was initially made using Javascript, Express and socket.io, and it
is now using NextJS with socket.io and Typescript.

It is still missing Styling, and I will eventually do that.

Maybe I will add more features to this, maybe not. This was a simple project
for me to understand how websockets work.
