# Real time chat

This will be my first real project, and will be programmed using Javascript.

- [ ] Have some Frontend design in mind
- [ ] Learn how to Websocket!?!?!?!?1
- [ ] Add users and basic auth (I won't do real auth because the point here is
  to learn websockets, not authentication)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel and show it off on the portfolio
