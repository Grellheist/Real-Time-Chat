# Real Time Chat

This project was initially made using Javascript, Express and socket.io, and it
is now using NextJS with socket.io and Typescript.

Maybe I will add more features to this, maybe not. This was a simple project
for me to understand how websockets work.

I am well aware that this doesn't look too good, but that wasn't the point. The
point was to learn how websockets work and how to integrate all that with Node
and eventually NextJS.

So this will stay as is for now.
