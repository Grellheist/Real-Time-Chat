# Real time chat

This will be my first real project, and will be programmed using Javascript.

For now this will be a very crude implementation but it is going to get more
sophisticated over time.

## The following comes from the basic chat "tutorial" found <a href="https://socket.io/get-started/chat/#homework">here</a>:

# Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- [ ] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- [ ] Add support for nicknames.
- [ ] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as they press enter.
- [ ] Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- [ ] Show who’s online.
- [ ] Add private messaging.
- [ ] Share your improvements!
